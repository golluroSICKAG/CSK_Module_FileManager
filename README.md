This module is part of the SICK AppSpace Coding Starter Kit developing approach.  
It is programmed in an object-oriented way. Some of the modules use kind of "classes" in Lua to make it possible to reuse code / classes in other projects.  
In general, it is not necessary to code this way, but the architecture of this app can serve as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.  
Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/docu/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit_Documentation.md) of CSK for further information.
